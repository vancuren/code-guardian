Can you update the settings with the following changes: 

1. Can we add a drop down for model. By default model should be gpt-5-nano but should include gpt-5, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-codex.

2. Can we store the API more securely. - API key for the AI provider is stored in VS Code settings (contributes.configuration.codeGuardian.apiKey) as plaintext. This can be exposed via settings export, backups, or UI and is not secured at rest.
